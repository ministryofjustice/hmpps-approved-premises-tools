        "emotionalIssuesDetails": "[10.9] Mr Smith told me that he was untroubled by mental health difficulties and had no history of self harm or suicidal thoughts",
        "drugIssuesDetails": "[8.9] Mr Smith told me that he had experimented with many drugs throughout his teens. He first used heroin when he was 15 years old but states he did not become addicted until he was 18. He said that he had remained in the grip of this addiction since that time, with some periods of abstinence.  He recalled that at its peak, his heroin addiction was such that he was using up to 1/8 of an ounce daily, supplementing his own use by selling this substance. The court will be aware that he has previously served two lengthy prison sentences for offences of supplying Class A drugs. Mr Smith has administered heroin intravenously",
        "alcoholIssuesDetails": "[9.9] Mr Smith told me that he rarely consumes alcohol and has not had any problems associated with excessive drinking in years.  He admitted that he occasionally used to drink to excess as a teenager, sometimes becoming involved in fights as a result. He was convicted of section 20 wounding in 1988, when he was 17, and he recalled that this incident had been partially triggered by alcohol.  He has a more recent conviction for Affray in 2004 which occurred in a put but Mr Smith says he had only had one pint, on that occasion having been on his way home from work.",
        "lifestyleIssuesDetails": "[7.9] Mr Smith has clearly had issues concerning the company he keeps, in that his involvement in the drug culture has at times been entrenched. For example, when he was selling drugs in order to supplement his own addiction.   Spending time with others who are drug users will undoubtedly increase the risk he poses of involvement in criminal activity, as well as undermining his efforts to become drug free, as evidenced by the circumstances of the current offence. However, as referred to earlier, he said that his family do not approve of drug use and represent an element of stability in his life. He is forty years of age now and is under no illusions regarding the impact that certain associates will have on his stated motivation to change.",
        "relationshipIssuesDetails": "[6.9] Mr Smith described his family as travellers.  He said that they were very supportive of him, although they had at times found it difficult to accept his involvement with drugs.  He has three children, aged 19, 16 and 14 from a previous relationship.  He told me that his eldest daughter is currently resident abroad but he has regular contact with his younger children.  Mr Smith said that he and his girlfriend have been together for approximately one year. She, too, has issues with drugs and is currently subject to a DRR.  He spoke of their shared motivation to stop using drugs, and commented that she is currently making significant progress.",
        "financeIssuesDetails": "[5.9] Mr Smith was in receipt of Job Seekers Allowance prior to his current remand in custody. He commented that he was generally good at managing his finances and said that he had no significant debts. However, in the past he has clearly offended regularly in order to fund his addition to drugs.  In addition, there was a financial element to the current matter, in that he believed he was being taken advantage of.",
        "educationTrainingEmploymentIssuesDetails": "[4.9] He said that he has since learnt to read and write during periods of custody and an initial assessment of his basic skills indeed indicates that he has adequate levels of literacy and numeracy ability. He said that in the past he had generally worked on an intermittent, ad hoc basis; including employment as a labourer, carpenter and road worker. Mr Smith told me that he was last employed in 2004.  he spoke of wanting to secure suitable employment although he knows that he will first need to fully address his drug issues.",
        "accommodationIssuesDetails": "[3.9] Mr Smith told me that he was renting a room in a shared house, prior to his current remand. He said that this accommodation had been facilitated by the One Tree Housing Association. He intends to move in with his girlfriend on his release.",
        "attitudeIssuesDetails": "[12.9] During interview, Mr Smith referred to being motivated to alter his lifestyle significantly and address his drug use. However, departmental records indicate that in the past he has expressed similar sentiments which have ultimately failed, resulting in further criminal activity. Therefore, he will need to be tenacious in sustaining his stated levels of motivation, possibly provide his absolute assurances to the court regarding his intentions in the event that he regains his liberty if he is to offered any further opportunity to avoid a prison sentence on this occasion.",
        "thinkingBehaviouralIssuesDetails": "[11.9] The circumstances of the current offence suggest that Mr Smith acted in an impulsive, ill considered and aggressive manner, paying scant regard to the consequences of his actions. He did, to his credit, acknowledges that he could and should have dealt with the situation in a more sensible and measured way. However, he did have some difficulty identifying how this could have been achieved.  Clearly, his involvement with illicit substances was a huge factor in his motivation for this offence:  the need to buy drugs and possibly the sub culture of criminality which permeates such transactions will have influenced his decision to resort to violence in order to vent his sense of grievance regarding the victim in this case.  I say this because it would appear that this..."
